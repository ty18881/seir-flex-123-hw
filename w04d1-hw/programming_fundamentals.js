/** One Sentence about each of the below programming concepts */

/**DRY*/
// Don't repeat yourself - Avoid repeating similar code blocks across the program.  


/** KISS */
// Keep it simple stupid -  Write simple code, use simple constructs to ensure code is easier to troubleshoot and maintain.


/** Avoid creating a YAGNI */
// YAGNI = you aren't going to need it
// Don't include program logic until you really need it.  
// I struggle with this one the most.  For me, there's a push-pull between sequential logic and creating functions.
// My tendency is to stick to sequential code but sometimes that's not the simplest or cleanest approach.

/** Do the simplest thing that could possibly work */
// Don't get fancy when something straightforward will get the job done.

/** Don't make me think */
// Don't require folks to use a Rosetta Stone to understand what your code is supposed to be doing.

/** Write code for the maintainer */
// Please comment your code so we don't spend most of our time figuring out what is supposed to be happening.

/** Single responsibility principle */
// I translate this as "specialization."  A block of code should do one thing.

/** Avoid premature optimization */
// Don't go for perfect when it won't give you significant improvement.

/** Separation of concerns */
// Functions should specialize and not have overlapping responsibilities.
